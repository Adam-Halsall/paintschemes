# paintschemes
This is a reference page for all my paint schemes for different minis for Warhammer 40,000

I developed this using a Xubuntu VM, VScode, and CLI for Git interaction.

This project is a tool to facilitate my HTML/CSS and Git learning. It's taught me a lot, for example:
* Full page creation in HTML
* How to create, stick to, and modify (when needed) HTML structure decisions
* Detailed interaction with CSS hierarchy and formatting tweaks
* How to create a responsive navigation menu
* How to accurately and consistently use CSS selectors and pseudo-selectors
* How to use a span element with classes to define reusable colour swatches to assist in paint colour referencing
* Anchor linking/simple navigation design patterns
* How to embed Instagram posts
* How to use VScode, especially Emmet abbreviation and wrap to increase productivity
